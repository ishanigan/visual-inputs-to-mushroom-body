# hemibrain_olf_data
Data on FIB hemibrain olfactory neurons that will be useful for analysis in upcoming FIB hemibrain papers.

It includes primary data such as classification of hemibrain olfactory and thermo/hygrosensory (VP) uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) and multiglomerular ones, and comparison of certain features with FAFB.

* bodyid, here named as skid
* hemibrain name (might be out of date)
* tract
* glomerulus for uni- or biglomerular PNs
* PN_type: for `VP_PNs file.csv` only.
* lineage
* new_type_name: shown in neuPrint as type, with a few exceptions: those in which the lineage is one of these 

mdPN	> A
lvPN2	>	B
ilPN	> C1/C2
ilvPN	> D
ivPN	>	E
ivmPN	> F
VUMa2	>	G

Until the neuPrint v1.1 is released, the type shown in neuPrint Explorer are the ones on the right.

* valence: for `VP_PNs file.csv` only.
* type: fib or fafb
* hemisphere: FAFB.RHS, FAFB.LHS or FIB

The file `FIB_uPNs.csv` lists all uniglomerular olfactory uPNs. Two neurons have a `?` after their glomerulus. This is because these are non-classical uPNs, i.e., their arborisation in the antennal lobe extends beyond the borders of one glomerulus, although the majority of their input is from that glomerulus only (see [Bates &Schlegel, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.19.911453)). The best NBLAST match of these 2 hemibrain neurons in FAFB is not perfect, but good enought to putatively consider these 2 neurons as VC3l uPNs.

The file `FIB_VP_PNs.csv` lists all thermo- and hygrosensory PNs (uni-, bi- and nultiglomerular ones) as identified by Lisa Marin (for more info see [Marin 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.20.912709v2). Some multiglomerular ones might also receive some olfactory input, but the expectation is that most input will be thermo-sensory. This is reflected in the type name - starts with 'VP'.

The file `FIB_mPNs.csv` lists all remaining multiglomerular PNs. Each of these bodyids was matched to a neuron we have traced in FAFB. The `new_type_name` starts with 'olfactory' if the best match in FAFB receives a majority (>70%) of olfactory input. If this is not the case, the `new_type_name` does not include 'olfactory, reflecting the fact that it receives a mix of olfactory and thermo/hygrosensory input. In the few cases where the FAFB match was not perfect, we follow the latter rule for type naming, so without specifying type of input.

The file `odour_scenes.csv` includes for each glomerulus, the known ligand for those sensory neurons, which odour scene it relates to and the valence. Please not that some valences are not known, or clear in different contexts. This file is the same as figure S7 of [Bates &Schlegel, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.19.911453).

The file `uPNsdf_FIB_FAFB.csv` includes for each classical (i.e. canonical) uPNs a comparison of the number of individuals per type, between the right hemipshere of FAFB and FIB.
* FAFB.RHS: number in FAFB.RHS
* FIB: number in hemibrain
* RHS.FIB: difference between FAFB.RHS and FIB
* lineage: this column distinguishes between embryonic and larval PNs of the anterodorsal lineage (e adPN or l adPN)
* birth order: the assignement of DP1l, VC5 and DC4 to e adPN is based on our data. So the placement in the birth order is putative, according to gaps in order as already described in the literature.
